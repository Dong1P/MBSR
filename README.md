We plan to upload 'learned network for NTIRE competition (CVPRW 2018)' to other places due to capacity.
# Title : Efficient Module Based SR for multiple problems 
# EMBSR
# Dependencies
Python (Tested with 3.6)
PyTorch >= 0.3.1

You may freely use and distribute this software as long as you retain the author's name (myself and/or my students) with the software.
It would also be courteous for you to cite the toolbox and any related publications in any papers that present results based on this software. A typical citation is like: Dongwon park, "MBSR," available at [url], downloaded [date].
UM and the authors make all the usual disclaimers about liability etc.
If you make changes to any files, then please change the file name before redistributing to avoid confusion (like the GNU software license). Better yet, email me the changes and I'll consider incorporating them into the toolbox.


We get a lot of help from the site below.
